## Deblurring with neural networks

> This project is made for our signal class at Universit√© Gustave Eiffel.

### Requirements for the project 

- Each project requires reading and understanding.

- Each project requires some coding (not only using some existing toolbox).
- Each project requires a testing phase of the methods *on your own data*.

#### Presentation

The duration of the presentation is 15/20 minutes.

~10-15 slides with the following wireframe : 

- Title / name
- Presentation of the problem
- Proposed methods
- Theoretical analysis
- Numerical findings
- Critics
- Conclusion / perspective

#### Report

- You must bring a printed version with your to give me before the presentation. This is a strict deadline. 
- Not less than 4 pages and up to 12 pages (A4, 11pt font, single column), including roughly one page of bibliography.
- Should be similar to a (short) scientific article. 
- When presenting the numerics, give all parameters, so that the results are reproducible. 
- It should not be a rewriting of the original article. You should only report about what you have done and only explain the theory that is relevant to explain the numerics you have done.
- Suggestion of structure for the report: 
  - Abstract: 
    - What problem(s) is studied ? 
    - Why is it relevant ? 
    - What solution(s) is proposed ? 
    - Which contributions (theory, numerics, etc) ? 
  - Introduction : 
    - Presentation of the problem(s). 
    - Previous works (at least a few citations). If relevant, include things that you have seen during the lectures.
    - 
    - Contributions. Why is the studied method different/better/worse/etc. than existing previous works. 
  - Main body (~10 pages) : 
    - Presentation of the method(s). 
    - Theoretical guarantees. 
    - Numerics. 
  - Conclusion and perspective (~1 page)
    - Summary of the result obtained: pros and cons (limitation, problems, error in the articles, etc)
    - Possible improvement/extension
  - Bibliography (~1 page)
